This app acts as a history for spotify users to see their most listened to tracks, artists and genres. Going further it will give recommendations and connect you with other users where you can display your "Wraps" in a feed style environment. You can follow other users and have your feed filter by that. An account in our app can be altered by changing username or password and can also be deleted.
